# Original Description:
# The “rate” option should provide the net score and sub-scores from Project 1,
# to inform prospective users of the quality of the module.
# It should also include one new metric: The fraction of its dependencies
# that are pinned to at least a specific major+minor version,
# e.g. version 2.3.X of a package.
# (If there are zero dependencies, they should receive a 1.0 rating.
# If there are two dependencies, one pinned to this degree,
# then they should receive a ½ = 0.5 rating).
